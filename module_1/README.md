React Fundamentals

- React is developed by Facebook
- The best part of React is we don't have to worry about keeping our state(held in JS) and our UI(DOM) in sync.
-  what is DOM
    - DOM is the living structure that makes up a live website/web application. when we visit a website, the browser turns the static HTML into the DsdOM.
    Eg: blue print of a car is HTML and the car itself is DOM.
    - When we use tool like react, it works by interacting with the DOM via JavaScript. It'll create, update, and delete DOM elements as required.
